# Project-DSML-Rolex
 The Challenge : The university’s library platform holds a rich collection of data, every user’s borrowing history and detailed metadata about each book (titles, authors, subjects, etc.). Our mission is to use this data to predict the top 10 books each user is most likely to borrow next : ### build an AI Librarian.

This AI Librarian should:
    - Understand what books users like;
    - Recommend new items intelligently;
    - Learn from feedback;
    - And (maybe) even talk like a real librarian.
